The Reasoning Behind CMK Selection (by chatgpt, based on data from filters.py)

The CMK tag serves as an indicator of whether a given step aligns with fundamental principles
of traditional energy work and internal cultivation. Its selection follows a structured rationale
based on factors such as originality, the depth of internal practice, and the intended purpose of the movement.

Originality and Traditional Knowledge
A strong correlation exists between original steps and the CMK = True designation. Steps that are foundational,
time-tested, or part of a well-established internal system tend to be recognized as essential components of
energy cultivation. These movements often carry the essence of traditional practice and remain unchanged through
generations. Conversely, derivative steps—those that have been adapted, modified, or developed as variations—are
more likely to be marked CMK = False, as they may lack the same depth of traditional refinement.

Internal Energy Work vs. External Movements
The CMK tag also distinguishes between movements that cultivate internal energy (Neigong) and those that emphasize
external coordination or physical conditioning. Steps associated with deep internal work, such as qigong invocation
or energy circulation, tend to be classified as CMK = True. These include movements like 'twist_waist_look_back',
'gaze_moon', and 'five_hearts_breathing', all of which engage core energy pathways and are designed to refine internal balance.

In contrast, steps that prioritize relaxation, martial application, or biomechanical coordination often fall under CMK = False.
Many Bagua and Taiji movements, as well as those classified under Xiaoyao, belong to this category. While these movements
\may offer health benefits and fluid motion, they do not always adhere to the strict internal principles that define core energy work.

Purpose and Functional Categorization
Another determining factor is the goal of the step. Movements aimed at invocation or workout—where energy is actively
engaged or refined—are more likely to be CMK = True. These steps often involve breath control, meridian activation,
or a deep connection between movement and internal flow. On the other hand, movements designed for relaxation or
coordination tend to be marked CMK = False, as their primary focus is on bodily ease and external form rather than energy transformation.

Exceptions and Special Cases
Although these general patterns hold true, there are notable exceptions. Some derivative steps still carry a CMK = True designation
because they preserve essential energy cultivation methods despite their modified form. This can be seen in 'wuxin', 'lungs_gut',
and 'backward_bowing', which, despite being adaptations, retain a core connection to internal work. Conversely, a few original
steps are CMK = False, likely due to their biomechanical focus rather than internal refinement. Examples include 'knee_top_head' and
'lift_hip', which emphasize coordination rather than deep energy work.

Conclusion
The CMK tag serves as a meaningful distinction between core traditional movements and those that are derivative,
experimental, or externally focused. It prioritizes steps that cultivate internal energy, maintain traditional authenticity,
and adhere to refined Neigong principles. While many qigong steps are CMK-approved, movements from Bagua, Taiji, and Xiaoyao
often lack the same depth of internal practice.

The selection of CMK is not merely about tradition but about whether a movement preserves the essential qualities of internal cultivation.
